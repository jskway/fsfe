## Introduction

### Terminal vs Shell

**Terminal**: Runs shell applications (eg. iTerm2)

**Shell**: Command interpreter that interfaces with the system (eg. bash, zsh,
fish)

**ping \<url\>** - used as a simple way to verify that a computer can communicate
over the network with another computer

**traceroute \<url\>** - shows you the route a packet takes, starting from your computer
to the destination

## Servers

**kernel**: the core component of an operating system. It acts as
a bridge between applications and the machine hardware. It's responsible for
low-level tasks such as: disk management, task management and memory management.

**utilities (OS)**: essentially tiny little applications that do one thing

**SSH (Secure Shell):** enables you to securely log on
to a remote computer and perform shell and network services.

A **SSH key pair** is made up a public key and a private key. The private key stays
on your computer and the public key goes on a server. Everything is encrypted
with the private key.

### Creating ssh keys

Move into .ssh directory

`cd ~/.ssh`

Generate ssh key

`ssh-keygen`

\<filename\>.pub is the public SSH key, which you can copy and add to your
server instance.

### Connecting to the server

SSH into server

`ssh root@<SERVER_IP>`

If you get Permission Denied, it's because the default key pair is `id_ssh` and
SSH is going to try to look there first. If that doesn't work, it essentially
says "I don't know, your key is not matching the public key that we have in the
server". We get solve this by running:

`ssh -i <private_key_name> root@<SERVER_IP>`

On the latest versions of macOS, once you've successfully connected it will
automatically add the private key to the keychain so can just run
`ssh root@<SERVER_IP>` in the future.

## Domain Setup

### DNS Records

**A Records**: map names to IP addresses

**CNAME**: map names to other names (eg. custom domain -> netlify
domain)

Add 2 `A Records` with your IP address

- @
- www

Add the A Records with your new domain on your cloud provider's dashboard

Update the nameservers on your domain registrar's dashboard

## [Server Setup (Ubuntu)](./serverSetup.md)

1. Update software
2. Create a new user
3. Make that user a super user
4. Enable login for new user
5. Disable root login

** You always want to disable root login. There's never a reason to login as
root. It will only expose yourself to more attacks. **

## Bash Basics

### Standard Streams

**Standard Streams** are interconnected input/output
communication channels between a computer program and its environment.

- Standard output (`stdout`)

- Standard input (`stdin`)

- Standard error (`stderr`)

This is the standard API across nearly all Unix applications.

### Redirection

- | (read from stdout)
- \> (write stdout to file)
- \>\> (append stdout to file)
- < (read from stdin)
- 2> (read from stderr)

`ps` - shows a snapshot of the current processes

`grep 'REGEX_PATTERN'` - prints lines that match patterns

`ps | grep bash` - takes all the output of PS, passes it to `grep` which will
run a regex on it, and returns the lines that match `bash`

### Finding Things

#### Find

`find /directory -option file.txt` - search for file/folder names

Find all log files in /var/log/nginx

`find /var/log/nginx -type f -name "*.log"`

Find all directories with the name 'log'

`find / -type d -name log`

#### Grep

`grep -options 'expression' /path/to/directory` - search file contents

Over time, log files automatically get concatenated and gzipped. zgrep can be
very useful for searching inside these files.

`zgrep FILE` - search inside gzip file

Find running node processes

`ps aux | grep node`

## Security

Read auth log

`sudo cat /var/log/auth.log`

### Security Checklist

- SSH
- Firewalls
- Updates
- Two factor authentication
- VPN

#### Application Updates

Install unattended upgrades

`sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`

This will automatically upgrade your software for security or minor fixes

View configuration file

`cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`

#### Firewalls

**Firewall:** A network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing
network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on
a defined set of security rules.

**nmap:** a port scanner that can run over an entire range of ip addresses and
checks for open ports

**port**: a communication endpoint that maps to a specific process or network
service

Every port that is open to the Internet exposes another potential vulnerability
that can be exploited.  In general, you want the minimum amount of ports you
need running - ports are closed by default.

Install nmap

`sudo apt install nmap`

Run nmap

`nmap YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`

Run nmap with more service/version info

`nmap -sV YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`

#### ufw

**ufw (uncomplicated firewall)**: a program for managing a Linux firewall 

Check firewall status

`sudo ufw status`

Enable ssh

`sudo ufw allow ssh`

Enable http

`sudo ufw allow http`


Enable firewall

`sudo ufw enable`

#### Permissions

Permissions are kind of based on the idea that eventually someone probably will
get into your server.  Permissions mean locking down what you can do with a
file. Eg. read, write and execute.

[Linux Chmod Permissions Cheat Sheet](https://isabelcastillo.com/linux-chmod-permissions-cheat-sheet)

Apply the least priviledge principle - don't give any  more permissions then a user
needs.

#### Upgrade Node

## HTTP

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is a set of rules that defines how code
moves between the client and server.  The entire model of HTTP is built around 
requests and responses.

### Headers

Packets are made up of metadata and data.  Part of that metadata is the HTTP
header.  It can tell you where the packet is coming from, what kind of encoding
it has, what kind of content it has, and a bunch of other information you can
pack and unload.  Headers are good for adding and subtracting information along
the way to its destination.  (Eg. NGINX headers, Express headers)

Example of a Request header:

```xml
GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
```

**Common Headers**

| Name       | Description     |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| User-agent | The requesting device type   |
| Accept | What the device will handle |
| Accept-language | Browser languages |
| Content-type | The type of media |
| Set-cookie | Sets stateful information |
| X- | Typically used for custom headers |

A **cookie** is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser.
The browser can store it and send it back with later requests to the same server.

The internet is stateless - every request and response is a brand new request
and response.  The server doesn't remember that you've been here or not. 
Cookies allow us to persist data over time and allows things like
authentication, storing user preferences, etc.  The dangerous thing about
cookies is that persist over every single request unless you expire them.

Example of a Response header:

```xml
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:06:00 GMT
Etag: "c561c68d0ba92bbeb8b0f612a9199f722e3a621a"
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=997
Last-Modified: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 02:36:04 GMT
Server: Apache
Set-Cookie: mykey=myvalue; expires=Mon, 17-Jul-2017 16:06:00 GMT; Max-Age=31449600; Path=/; secure
```

**Status Code Categories**

| Code       | Description     |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| 1xx | Information |
| 2xx | Success  |
| 3xx | Redirect |
| 4xx | Client error |
| 5xx | Server error |

### HTTPS

"**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is an encrypted version of the HTTP
protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and
a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive
data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping."
â€“ [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/https)

#### Adding HTTPS to NGINX

Go to [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and follow their instructions

You may need to set the server name in nginx to your domain names

`sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

After following the instructions on Certbot, we need to open port 443 on our
firewall:

`sudo ufw allow https`

### HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2

With HTTP/1.1, every single request has it's own thread or connection.

HTTP/2 enables multiplexing.  So we can make one connection, and make multiple
requests over that single connection.

Enable http2 in nginx

`sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

`listen 443 http2 ssl;` <- Just add http2

Reload nginx

`sudo service nginx reload`

[Akamai HTTP/2 Demo](https://http2.akamai.com/demo)

#### HTTP/3

Google invented a protocol called QUIC, which enables HTTP over UDP.  This is
essentially HTTP/3, but isn't widely supported yet by all browsers.

## Containers

**Microservices**: an architectural style that structures an application as a
collection of loosely coupled services.

**Containers** are a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
dependencies.  Containers enable your applications to run quickly and reliably
in different environments.  

Benefits of containers:
- Lightweight
- Portable
- Easier for development
- Easier to manage
- Faster startup
- Decouple application from infrastructure

**Docker** is the biggest containerization service in the world today.

**Kubernetes** is a open-source system for the orchestration layer - it's what
controls the rolling out of all the containers you're deploying

**Load balancers** are servers that evenly distribute incoming requests to
multiple downstream servers to prevent a single server from being over utilized.

Load balancers work with scheduling algorithms, which determine which server a
request is forwarded to.  Examples:
- Round Robin
- IP Hashing
- Random Choice
- Least Connections
- Least Load
